## Key Areas of Space Infrastructure Development

### **Energy Generation and Storage**
Energy generation is fundamental to any space settlement. Technologies such as **space-based solar power** and nuclear energy are being developed to provide reliable energy for habitats, mining operations, and transportation. Solar arrays placed in orbit or on planetary surfaces can supply power continuously, while nuclear reactors, such as small modular reactors, offer a dependable energy source for longer missions.

### **Transportation Systems Between Space Habitats and Planets**
Developing transportation infrastructure is crucial for moving resources and personnel between space habitats, the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies. Current research focuses on using **in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)** to produce propellants from lunar or Martian materials, reducing dependence on Earth for fuel. This approach will significantly cut transportation costs and make interplanetary travel more sustainable.

### **Mining and Resource Extraction on Asteroids and Moons**
Extracting resources from the Moon, Mars, and asteroids will be vital for constructing space habitats and producing fuel, water, and breathable air. Research from the University of Surrey's **Lunar Construction and In-Situ Resource Utilisation Group** explores technologies like **microwave heating** to extract materials from lunar regolith. This method is more efficient and cost-effective, enabling the production of essential elements such as iron, titanium, and oxygen.
