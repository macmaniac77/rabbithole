# Space Habitat Design

Designing habitats for long-duration space missions requires innovative solutions that address the challenges of deep space environments. From modular, expandable structures to advanced life support systems, space habitats must be sustainable, scalable, and equipped to support human life in extreme conditions.

## Key Features

1. **Modular and Expandable Designs**  
   Modern space habitats use modular and inflatable designs that expand in space, providing larger living and working areas without increasing launch payload volume. These habitats, like those developed by Sierra Space and NASA, can grow to several times their packed size, offering more comfortable and functional spaces for astronauts.

2. **Radiation Shielding**  
   One of the primary concerns in space is radiation exposure. Inflatable habitats, such as those developed by Lockheed Martin, integrate advanced materials that offer superior protection against cosmic and solar radiation, significantly improving safety on long-duration missions to Mars and beyond.

3. **Life Support Systems**  
   Space habitats must have closed-loop life support systems to recycle air, water, and waste. These systems are critical for maintaining a healthy environment for crew members, especially on missions beyond low-Earth orbit.

4. **Protection from Space Debris**  
   Space debris poses a constant risk. Advanced materials used in habitats, such as Vectran™, are stronger than steel and help absorb impacts from micro-meteoroids and orbital debris, keeping astronauts safe in orbit.
