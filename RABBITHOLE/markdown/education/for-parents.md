- **Provide Sorting and Matching Activities:** Use household items (e.g., buttons, toys) to sort by color, size, or shape. Discuss each item's characteristics during the activity.
- **Encourage Creative Art Projects:** Offer finger paints, playdough, or collage materials. Let them manipulate materials freely to develop dexterity.
- **Incorporate Daily Tasks:** Involve your child in simple chores, like sorting laundry or setting the table, to practice their grasping and manipulation skills.

### 8. Multi-Word Formation to Simple Sentences
- **Encourage Storytelling:** Ask your child to tell you about their day or describe a favorite toy. Prompt them with questions to help them expand their sentences.
- **Use Visual Aids:** Create a storybook with pictures of family members, pets, or places. Encourage your child to create sentences or stories based on the visuals.
