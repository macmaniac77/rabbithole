## Key Aspects of Data Optimization

- **Data Collection and Processing**: Acquiring high-quality images of wildlife from the pond environment, ensuring diversity in the dataset for robust training.
- **Label Validation and Review**: Using human-in-the-loop validation to ensure that model predictions are accurate, and that the labels applied to the data are correct.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Implementing a feedback mechanism that allows for the iterative improvement of the AI models as new data is collected and processed.
