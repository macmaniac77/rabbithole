# Agents in the Rabbit Hole

This document outlines the integration of AI agents, specifically Gemini, into the rabbit hole generation architecture.

## Gemini Integration

Gemini will be the primary AI model for content generation and interaction within the rabbit hole. Its capabilities will be leveraged in the following ways:

*   **Content Generation:** Gemini will be used to generate new markdown documents based on user prompts or existing content. This will allow for the rapid expansion of the rabbit hole.
*   **Content Alteration:** Gemini will assist in modifying and updating existing documents, ensuring the content remains relevant and accurate.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Users will be able to interact with Gemini to ask questions about the content, request summaries, or explore related topics within the rabbit hole.

## Stripe Webhook and GitHub Updates

(Placeholder for Stripe webhook integration details. This section will describe how payments or other events trigger updates to the GitHub repository, potentially through automated content generation or other mechanisms.)

## Future Enhancements

*   **Wikipedia-like Component:** We envision a future where users can contribute to and edit the content in a collaborative manner, similar to Wikipedia. Gemini can play a role in moderating edits, suggesting improvements, and ensuring consistency.
*   **Tokenized Data:** We plan to incorporate large datasets, such as "canon like the bible all tokenized data," into the system. Gemini will be instrumental in processing, indexing, and making this data accessible and searchable within the rabbit hole.
