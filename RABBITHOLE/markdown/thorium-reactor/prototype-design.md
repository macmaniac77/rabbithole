# Prototype Molten Salt Reactor Design

This section outlines the design and development of the first commercial thorium molten salt reactor prototype, based on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

## Base Design

- Rooted in the ORNL MSRE, our prototype is a ~60MW thermal reactor.
- **Safety and Scalability**: Molten salt reactors operate at low pressure, minimizing the risk of catastrophic accidents and enabling efficient scaling.
- **Cleaner Energy**: Thorium reactors produce significantly less radioactive waste compared to traditional uranium reactors.

### Key Features

1. **Low-Pressure Operation**: Unlike traditional light water reactors, molten salt reactors operate at near-atmospheric pressure, reducing the risk of explosive pressure buildup [1].
2. **Passive Safety Systems**: The design incorporates passive safety features, such as freeze plugs, that automatically shut down the reactor in case of power loss or overheating [2].
3. **High Temperature Operation**: The reactor operates at higher temperatures than conventional reactors, allowing for improved thermal efficiency and potential use in industrial processes [3].

## Modifications and Enhancements

Our reactor design includes several custom modifications to optimize performance and maximize the extraction of valuable isotopes:

- **Customized Bismuth Extraction System**: Enables the extraction of elements like lithium-6, molybdenum-99, and strontium-90 for industrial and medical use.
- **High-Quality Component Integration**: Leveraging the latest technological advancements to replace outdated commercial parts, enhancing thermal efficiency.

### Advanced Materials

Recent research has focused on developing materials that can withstand the corrosive nature of molten salts under radiation. A study by MIT researchers has shown that certain metal alloys can actually become more resistant to corrosion when exposed to radiation under specific conditions [4].

Key findings include:
- Alloys with higher concentrations of corrosion-resistant elements like nickel perform better in molten salt environments.
- Radiation can cause the formation of a protective layer that slows down the corrosion process in some alloys.

## Isotope and Hydrogen Production

This reactor focuses on producing rare isotopes and hydrogen, providing a rapid pathway to profitability while demonstrating the reactor's utility for future power production.

- **Isotope Extraction**: Thorium reactors can efficiently produce high-value isotopes such as Mo-99 (used in medical diagnostics) and Li-6 (crucial for nuclear applications).
- **Hydrogen Production**: On-site hydrogen production for industrial partners, reducing transport costs and adding another revenue stream.

### Potential for Hydrogen Economy

The high operating temperatures of molten salt reactors make them ideal candidates for efficient hydrogen production through thermochemical water splitting processes. This could play a crucial role in the development of a hydrogen-based economy [5].

## Future Research Directions

Based on suggestions from experts in the field, several areas of research could significantly improve the prospects of commercially viable molten salt reactors [6]:

1. **Thermostat negative temperature control**: Developing designs with strong negative temperature coefficients at high temperatures and low fission product burden.
2. **All carbon composite primary system**: Exploring the use of carbon composites for high-temperature operation (900°C - 1050°C) to enable direct cycle gas turbines or hydrogen production.
3. **Alternative salt formulations**: Investigating salt compositions that avoid issues associated with lithium and beryllium.
4. **Safeguards and non-proliferation analyses**: Understanding proliferation issues in the Th-U-233 cycle.
5. **Centrifuge for noble and semi-noble metal separations**: Improving extraction and handling of precipitating fission products.

By utilizing advanced technology and strategic design, we aim to build a reactor that not only demonstrates the viability of thorium energy but also generates valuable products for today's markets.
