# Investment Opportunities

This section details the investment strategy and opportunities for developing and scaling the thorium molten salt reactor project.

## Initial Investment: $200 Million

Our investment strategy is designed to ensure rapid return on investment through hydrogen and isotope production.

- **Hardware and Infrastructure**: $150M for the design, setup, and equipment for the 60MW thermal reactor.
- **Personnel**: $25M for the hiring and training of core team members, including engineers, machinists, and legal experts.
- **Regulatory Costs**: $20M for navigating the complex regulatory framework surrounding nuclear energy, obtaining permits, and conducting safety simulations.
- **Miscellaneous and Contingency**: $5M for unforeseen costs and potential overruns.

## Break-even Projection: 2 to 5 Years

With early-stage investment focused on prototype development, we expect to break even within 2 to 5 years, thanks to the profitability of isotope and hydrogen production.

## Market Strategy and Revenue Streams

Our strategy is built around generating income from multiple streams:

- **Rare Isotope Sales**: Isotopes like molybdenum-99, lithium-6, and strontium-90 can be sold for thousands of dollars per gram, serving industries like medical research and satellite technology.
- **Hydrogen for Industrial Use**: We are targeting partnerships with industries such as steel refineries and chemical companies, offering on-site hydrogen production to reduce transport costs.

By securing medium-term purchase agreements with these industries (2-7 years), we will ensure a steady demand for our reactorâ€™s products and create long-term relationships.
