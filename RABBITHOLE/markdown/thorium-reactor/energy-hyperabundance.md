## What is Energy Hyperabundance?

Energy hyperabundance refers to the state where energy is so plentiful and inexpensive that it drives exponential economic and technological growth, lowering the cost of goods and services while improving quality of life.

Thorium reactors are a key component of this vision, as they:

- **Offer Abundant Fuel**: Thorium is more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium, providing a nearly inexhaustible source of nuclear fuel.
- **Reduce Waste**: Thorium reactors produce significantly less long-lived radioactive waste compared to traditional reactors.
- **Increase Safety**: Operating at low pressure, thorium reactors minimize the risk of catastrophic accidents.

## Applications of Hyperabundant Energy

Energy hyperabundance has far-reaching applications, transforming industries, economies, and societies:

- **Powering Cities and Industries**: Abundant, cheap energy will allow cities and factories to operate more efficiently, reducing costs and increasing productivity.
- **Space Exploration**: With enough energy, we can push the boundaries of human exploration, powering spacecraft, and colonizing other planets.
- **Technological Innovation**: Unlimited access to cheap energy fuels innovation, enabling the development of new technologies that were previously too resource-intensive.
