## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: AI-based systems continuously monitor equipment, sensors, and processes, identifying deviations from normal behavior and alerting personnel to potential issues before they lead to failures.
  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Advanced machine learning algorithms detect anomalies in operational data, such as unusual vibrations, temperature spikes, or pressure fluctuations. These systems can predict potential failures by identifying abnormal patterns and trends early on.
