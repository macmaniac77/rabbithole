# Bitcoin Proof-of-Stake Governance

This project is a proposal for a new proof-of-stake governance system for Bitcoin, designed to scale governance based on the principle of "orders of magnitude."

- Stake-based voting and decision-making
- Orders of magnitude structure to ensure balanced governance
- Aligning validation with governance participation
